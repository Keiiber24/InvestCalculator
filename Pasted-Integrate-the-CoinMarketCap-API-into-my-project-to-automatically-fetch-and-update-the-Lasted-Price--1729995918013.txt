Integrate the CoinMarketCap API into my project to automatically fetch and update the "Lasted Price" column in the "Trades by Market" table. The goal is to use real-time cryptocurrency prices from CoinMarketCap and display them in this table.

Steps to follow:
Register for the CoinMarketCap API:
Ensure that a valid CoinMarketCap API Key is generated from the CoinMarketCap Developer Portal.

CoinMarketCap API Documentation
Install the required package (if necessary):
Use a package like requests to send HTTP requests to the CoinMarketCap API.

API Key Setup:
Securely store the CoinMarketCap API Key as an environment variable in the project. Ensure the key is loaded using os.getenv() or a similar method to protect sensitive information.

Connect to the CoinMarketCap API:
Establish a connection to the CoinMarketCap API using the API Key. You will need to query the /v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest endpoint to fetch real-time prices for each cryptocurrency ticker.

Update the "Lasted Price" column:
Modify the current table that contains trade history:

For each row in the "Trades by Market" table, use the ticker symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH) to fetch the real-time price from CoinMarketCap.
Update the "Lasted Price" column with the fetched price for each trading pair.
Display in "Trades by Market" table:
Ensure that the updated "Lasted Price" is visible in the "Trades by Market" table within the project.

Save the updated table:
Once the prices have been updated, save the trade history with the updated "Lasted Price" values to a file (e.g., CSV) or the appropriate data storage system used in the project.

Error handling and testing:
Ensure that the system gracefully handles any errors, such as:

API request limits or timeouts.
Invalid ticker symbols.
After implementing the changes, test the integration by running the script and verifying that the prices in the "Lasted Price" column are updated correctly with real-time data from CoinMarketCap and are properly displayed in the "Trades by Market" table.
