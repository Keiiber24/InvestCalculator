Load the Trade History data:

The data is stored in a file called trade_history.csv.
This CSV contains fields such as:
Date and Time: When the trade was logged.
Ticker: The symbol of the traded asset (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).
Price: The entry price of the asset when it was bought.
Total Units: The total number of units purchased.
Remaining Units: The number of units left unsold.
Action: Indicates if the trade is Open (still has remaining units) or Closed (all units sold).
Partial sale data is stored in a History Modal, which shows Units Sold, Sale Price, and P/L.
Fetch the Latest Price via API:

Use the provided API to fetch the most recent price for any given Ticker.
Each time the summary is generated, the Last Price should be fetched live for open positions to ensure the Current Market Value is always accurate.
Example API URL: https://api.example.com/prices/{ticker}
Replace {ticker} with the asset's ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
Create the Log Summary Table:

For each trade, extract the following fields from the Trade History:
Status: If Remaining Units == 0, the trade is Closed; otherwise, it’s Open.
Ticker: The asset symbol.
Average Entry Price: The entry price at which the units were bought.
Units Purchased: The total number of units purchased.
Remaining Units: The number of units still unsold.
Action: Whether the trade is Open or Closed.
Realized P/L: For closed trades, calculate the realized profit or loss from partial/full sales. If the trade is open, this will be 0.
P/L %: For closed trades, calculate the percentage of profit or loss. For open trades, this will be calculated based on the Current Market Value.
Total Cost: Calculate the total cost of the trade as:
Total Cost
=
Entry Price
×
Units Purchased
Total Cost=Entry Price×Units Purchased
Last Price: Fetch this from the API for open trades. Use the closing price from the Trade History for closed trades.
Current Market Value: For open trades, calculate this as:
Current Market Value
=
Remaining Units
×
Last Price (via API)
Current Market Value=Remaining Units×Last Price (via API)
Open Date: Extract this from Trade History.
Close Date: Only for closed trades. Extract the date of the last sale.
Duration: Calculate the time difference between the Open Date and Close Date.
Store the Summary in a DataFrame:

After processing each trade, store the results in a pandas DataFrame.
Output the Log Summary:

The final table should contain the following columns:
Status, Ticker, Average Entry Price, Units Purchased, Remaining Units, Action, Realized P/L, P/L %, Total Cost, Current Market Value, Last Price, Open Date, Close Date, Duration.
Save this DataFrame as a CSV file named log_summary.csv.
